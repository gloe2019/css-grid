1. Define your grid
    Have a general idea of your pagelayout, and split them into columns and rows (markup your wireframe)
2. Choose your grid container, and set it to display:grid
    Note - every DIRECT child of the container will become a grid item!
3. Define the grid 
    Specify your column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
    Note - track sizes can be defined by any CSS units, as well as min-content(minimum size needed to fit the content of the container) and auto(resized unspecified field to fill up all available space)
4. Position grid items
    Items will be positioned in the next avaiable grid cell unless rules are explicitly defined using grid-column-start and grid-column-end

==========================================
Defining Grids: In-depth
    
Grid Track Sizes can be defined using many options
    - Static Values: px, rems, ems, ch, pt, pc
        These do not change, no matter what the viewport is.
    - Percentage - this is relative to the size of the grid. If the grid is responsive to the viewport, then the layout will be responsive as well.
    - Auto: let the browser decide. This is the default track size for CSS grid.
        You can use this if you have defined tracks and want to split up the remaining space between the undefined tracks
    - Fractional unit (fr): use to divide up the remaining space
        4 equal columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
        6 equal columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
        4 columns, 1 with 50% of content, and the rest divided equally: 2fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
    Viewport-responsive track size units: fr, %, auto
    
    There are also content-responsive track sizes! - size is determined by the contend within the grid cell
    - min-content: make the track as small as possible to fit its content
      ex: with text, it won't get small enough to break words.
